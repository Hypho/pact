# Changelog

All notable changes to PACT are documented here.

PACT follows semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

This changelog follows a Keep a Changelog style:
- newest releases first
- each release uses `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD`
- changes are grouped under `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`
- empty groups are omitted
- entries describe user- or maintainer-visible changes, not raw commit history
